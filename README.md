The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the human induced ecological crises, the limits that nature imposes on civilization and the underpinning of economic growth by fossil energy. 

The magnitude of the situation will require cooperation and expertise across cultures, demographics and professions.  There is no golden solution for the planet or humanity, but together we can become less destructive towards each other, the planet, and future generations.  

Let this be the beginning of a new reality.

This document will be organized in four sections 
* A: The earth's plight
* B: Vision
* C: What to do
* D: Resources, discussion groups

## the earth's plight

- A: Deep Time
- B: Human Cognitive Biases
- C: Population growth
- D: Peak Resources

  Oil, coal, phosphorous, even herring, all exhaustible/finite resources "peak".  Oil was the first and is the most common resource to be analyzed in this way.  When resource extraction rates are plotted against time, a curve resembling a Gaussian results.  The area under the curve is representative resources reserves.

The curve above (taken from oilcrash.com), shows an idealized Hubbert curve.  In the first phase, production increases rapidly, and then as the easily assessable parts of the resource declines, production levels off.  After "peaking" production still occurs but at exponentially smaller rates.  A range of factors influence the shape of actual curves, including technology, political instability, demand, economic trends, and government policy.

Mineral resources can be graphed the same as fuel minerals, but is more accurately graphed using exergy replacement cost, vs. mass due to non-fuel mineral quality degrading over time ([See Thanatia Chapter 13](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7323)). 

Biological resources that are being used faster than their replacement rate can also be modeled with Hubbert curves[^d1].  Sadly, many of our biological resources are being exploited faster than their replacement rate.  These will be discussed more specifically in later sections.


- E: Loss of top soil, freshwater.
- F: Mass Extinction
- G: Pollution, (y health)
- H: Climate Chanage, Ocean Acidification
- I: Renewable and repeatable resources

## vision

## what to do
The ways and amount in which one can combat the self-destructive tendencies of the human super organism will be varied depending on their own personal skillsets and life circumstances.  This section consists of ideas and projects that fellow eco-concious Homo sapiens are attempting or brainstorming.  Add to the list!

## resources

One of the first steps to take is to connect with those around you who are passionate about making a sustainable future a reality.  The amoeba organization is a loose collection of individuals interested and engadged in these topics.  Start or join a discussion group in your community.
