The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the human induced ecological crises, the limits that nature imposes on civilization and the underpinning of economic growth by fossil energy. 

The magnitude of the situation will require cooperation and expertise across cultures, demographics and professions.  There is no golden solution for the planet or humanity, but together we can become less destructive towards each other, the planet, and future generations.  

Let this be the beginning of a new reality.

This document will be organized in four sections 
* A: The earth's plight
* B: Vision
* C: What to do
* D: Resources, discussion groups

## the earth's plight

- A: Deep Time

  The earth is ~ 4.5 billion years old.[^1]  In that 4.5 billion of years there has been a dizzying array of different climates, ecosystems and life.  Human existance is a realitively short blip on the timespan of the earth, the first Homo sapiens appears in the fossil record about 200,000 years ago.[^2] Despite our seeming insignificance, we have managed to leave a permenenet mark on the geological record.  We are now living in the anthropocene.  Start dates for the anthropocene range are range from the megafaunal extinction to the trinity test[^3], but during this time we have markedly changed the composition of the atmosphere and our oceans, depleted signifcant amounts of top soil, and significantly altered hydrological and nutrient cycles.

## vision

## what to do
The ways and amount in which one can combat the self-destructive tendencies of the human super organism will be varied depending on their own personal skillsets and life circumstances.  This section consists of ideas and projects that fellow eco-concious Homo sapiens are attempting or brainstorming.  Add to the list!

## resources

One of the first steps to take is to connect with those around you who are passionate about making a sustainable future a reality.  The amoeba organization is a loose collection of individuals interested and engadged in these topics.  Start or join a discussion group in your community.
