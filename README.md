The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the human induced ecological crises, the limits that nature imposes on civilization and the underpinning of economic growth by fossil energy. 

The magnitude of the situation will require cooperation and expertise across cultures, demographics and professions.  There is no golden solution for the planet or humanity, but together we can become less destructive towards each other, the planet, and future generations.  

Let this be the beginning of a new reality.

This document will be organized in four sections 
* A: The earth's plight
* B: Vision
* C: What to do
* D: Resources, discussion groups

- E: Loss of top soil, freshwater.
- F: Mass Extinction
- G: Pollution, (y health)
- H: Climate Chanage, Ocean Acidification
- I: Renewable and repeatable resources

## what to do
The ways and amount in which one can combat the self-destructive tendencies of the human super organism will be varied depending on their own personal skillsets and life circumstances.  This section consists of ideas and projects that fellow eco-concious Homo sapiens are attempting or brainstorming.  Add to the list!
