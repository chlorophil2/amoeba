# amoeba

The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the human induced ecological crises, the limits that nature imposes on civilization and the underpinning of economic growth by fossil energy. 

The magnitude of the situation will require cooperation and expertise across cultures, demographics and professions.  There is no golden solution for the planet or humanity, but together we can become less destructive towards each other, the planet, and future generations.  

Let this be the beginning of a new reality.

This document will be organized in four sections 
* A: The earth's plight
* B: Vision
* C: What to do
* D: Resources, discussion groups

## the earth's plight

- A: Deep Time

  The earth is ~ 4.5 billion years old.[^1]  In that 4.5 billion of years there has been a dizzying array of different climates, ecosystems and life.  Human existance is a realitively short blip on geologic timescales: the first Homo sapiens only appears in the fossil record about 200,000 years ago.[^2] Despite our seeming insignificance, we have managed to leave a permenenet mark on the geological record.  We are now living in the anthropocene.  Start dates for the anthropocene range range from the megafaunal extinction to the trinity test[^3], but during this time we have markedly changed the composition of the atmosphere and our oceans, depleted signifcant amounts of top soil, and significantly altered hydrological and nutrient cycles.

- B: Human Cognitive Biases
- C: Population growth

  
    At the time of this being written(July of 2018) the Earth’s population is at roughly 7.3 billion people.[^4] For the time-span in which humans have existed on Earth(see Deep Time) we have survived in small, contained numbers; for most of human history, such a number as 7.3 billion would have been unthinkable. It wasn’t until the early 1800s when the planet first saw one billion humans, with two billion people occuring a mere 120 years later in 1920[^4]. It has only been in very recent human history that our species has been capable of growing to the colossal number which we know today. 

    There is a common population growth theory, proposed by Thomas Malthus in his 1798 writings, which states: exponential human population growth is inevitable, but will eventually be regulated through natural processes, such as disease, space, and food/water shortages; in essence, rapid growth in a species will always result in natural regulators. This idea, though proposed over 200 years ago, has been somewhat swept to the wayside primarily due to the boom of agricultural revolutions that have given humans a flawed and idealistic view of the Earth’s capability to house our numbers. Our means of energy use(especially in regards to agriculture) are unnatural and unsustainable. 

    Human-kinds’ manipulation of Earth’s natural systems has caused our species to undermine the natural corrective measures put forth by Mother Nature, leaving our species’ population to rapidly grow unchecked; however, Earth is a system that will always correct itself due to the finite energy that is contained within all systems. Eventually, our Earth will run out of the energy(the quick, cheap, accessible, and non-renewable kind) that has allowed our population to unreasonably boom for the last few centuries. 

    Ultimately, the current state of the human population can be summed up in one question: When humans’ numbers start inevitably declining, do we want it to be a result of our own controlled choice, or from the Earth choosing for us? 

- D: Peak Resources

  Oil, coal, phosphorous, even herring, all exhaustible/finite resources "peak".  Oil was the first and is the most common resource to be analyzed in this way.  When resource extraction rates are plotted against time, a curve resembling a Gaussian results.  The area under the curve is representative resources reserves.

The curve above (taken from oilcrash.com), shows an idealized Hubbert curve.  In the first phase, production increases rapidly, and then as the easily assessable parts of the resource declines, production levels off.  After "peaking", production still occurs but at exponentially smaller rates.  A range of factors influence the shape of actual curves, including technology, political instability, demand, economic trends, and government policy.

Mineral resources can be graphed the same as fuel minerals, but is more accurately graphed using exergy replacement cost, vs. mass due to non-fuel mineral quality degrading over time ([See Thanatia Chapter 13](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7323)). 

Biological resources that are being used faster than their replacement rate can also be modeled with Hubbert curves[^d1].  Sadly, many of our biological resources are being exploited faster than their replacement rate.  These will be discussed more specifically in later sections.


- E: Loss of top soil, freshwater.
- F: Mass Extinction
- G: Pollution, (y health)
- H: Climate Change, Ocean Acidification
- I: Renewable and repeatable resources

## vision

## what to do
The ways and amount in which one can combat the self-destructive tendencies of the human super organism will be varied depending on their own personal skillsets and life circumstances.  This section consists of ideas and projects that fellow eco-concious Homo sapiens are attempting or brainstorming.  Add to the list!

## resources

One of the first steps to take is to connect with those around you who are passionate about making a sustainable future a reality.  The amoeba organization is a loose collection of individuals interested and engadged in these topics.  Start or join a discussion group in your community.
