# amoeba

The aim of this project is to spread awareness of the human induced ecological crises, the limits that nature imposes on civilization and the underpinning of economic growth by fossil energy. 

The magnitude of the situation will require cooperation and expertise across cultures, demographics and professions.  There is no golden solution for the planet or humanity, but together we can become less destructive towards each other, the planet, and future generations.  

Let this be the beginning of a new reality.

This document will be organized in four sections 
* A: The earth's plight
* B: Vision
* C: What to do
* D: Resources
